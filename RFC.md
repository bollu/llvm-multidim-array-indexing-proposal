# Introducing a new multidimensional array indexing intrinsic

# Intrinsic specification

# Example
## allocating something of that shape
## indexing into something of that shape
## loop analyses that uses this

# Caveats

# Math
Please look at [the LaTeX document](formalism/main.pdf) which formalises
the indexing expressions used by the languages in consideration
(C++, Fortran, Chapel) and the corresponding equivalences.
